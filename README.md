My very first repository on GitHub!

Hi there,

I'm excited to be starting on GitHub!  Through all the various work I've done on computers so far, GitHub has been hovering there likea  cloud, either ready to nourish me with rain, or strike me down with lightening.  I hope to discover that GitHub is as benign as it is touted to be, and I look forward to using it this year.  I like programming in that it lets me build things, but I am more naturally drawn to the UIUX side of things, as I am more visual than abstract.  I want the tools, though, and I want to understand coding ina dn out!  Let's get to it!
